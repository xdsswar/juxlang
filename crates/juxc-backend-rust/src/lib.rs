//! Phase 19 — emit Rust source code.
//!
//! This is the **Phase 1 strategy** of the language plan
//! (`JUX-LANG-V1.md` §2.2) and the normative lowering described in
//! `JUX-COMPILER-PIPELINE-ADDENDUM.md` §C.9: the Jux compiler emits
//! idiomatic Rust source that `rustc` then compiles to the final binary.
//!
//! ## Mapping
//!
//! The full §C.9.2 mapping table is large; milestone 1 needs only:
//!
//! | Jux                                       | Rust                                |
//! |-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
//! | `public void main() { ... }`              | `fn main() { ... }`                 |
//! | `print(s)`                                | `println!("{}", s)`                 |
//! | `Literal::String("hi")`                   | `"hi"` (escaped for Rust)           |
//! | `Literal::Int(42)`                        | `42i64`                             |
//! | `Literal::Bool(true)`                     | `true`                              |
//! | `Literal::Null`                           | `()` (placeholder — see §C.9.4)     |
//!
//! Many more rows land as the language grows; each new construct goes in
//! the spec's mapping table first, then here.
//!
//! ## Module layout
//!
//! This crate is split into action-focused modules:
//!
//! - [`analysis`]    — pre-pass walkers and lvalue helpers.
//! - [`types`]       — type-position emission and visibility.
//! - [`decls`]       — class/record/enum/interface/function emitters.
//! - [`stmts`]       — block + statement emitters.
//! - [`exprs`]       — expression emitters and operator precedence.
//! - [`patterns`]    — switch and pattern lowering.
//! - [`sizeof_emit`] — `sizeof(...)` type-vs-value form selection.
//! - [`literals`]    — number/string/format literals and the indent helper.
//! - [`interp`]      — interpolated-string lowering.
